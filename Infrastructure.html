                    <P>Radha Krishna Mission School provides a classroom environment that fosters excellence and
                        motivates students towards better performance. Our classrooms are aesthetically designed and
                        integrated with smart boards and well-furnished desks. With technological support, our skilled
                        teachers provide guidance to each individual. The emphasis is on making every classroom session
                        interesting and interactive.</P>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">LIBRARY</h3>
                    <P>Acknowledging the fact that a library is a storehouse of knowledge, the school has provided
                        students with a library architecture that is inspirational and conducive to learning, improved
                        communication and interaction.<br><br>Our school library, a treasure trove of knowledge, has
                        state-of-the-art infrastructure to provide students a place to learn, think and share
                        ideas.<br><br>As knowledge is freely available in the digital world, we have incorporated
                        computer systems in our library along with an internet connection so that a world of knowledge
                        is readily available to students.<br><br>We believe such facilities fire children’s imagination,
                        and widen their knowledge horizons.
                    </P>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">SCIENCE LABS</h3>
                    <P>At Radha Krishna Mission School, we believe Nobel laureates are not created in huge research
                        facilities, but in the humble school labs. Our labs bring learning to life as students get to
                        explore, experiment and form their own conclusions. We make sure that our students are provided
                        with all facilities required for a practical experience – in Physics, Chemistry and Biology
                        labs.<br><br>
                        A hub of modern facilities and equipment, Presidium’s labs play a key role in educational
                        effectiveness of the curriculum in attaining effective, cognitive and practical goals.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">MATHEMATICS LAB</h3>
                    <P>To encourage students to learn through practice, we have provided our students with
                        fully-equipped mathematics lab. Here they can access the study materials for performing
                        different mathematical experiments. In addition to regular assignments, students also play
                        mathematical games like puzzles in the lab area.<br><br>Mathematics laboratory serves to teach
                        students about different methodologies and bridges the gap between the real and the abstract
                        world. Their skills of reasoning, logical thinking and connecting ideas enhance with every lab
                        session.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">COMPUTER LAB</h3>
                    <P>Information technology has become integral to every walk of life. With fully-equipped computer
                        lab, we expose students early to computer education. We have qualified teachers for assisting
                        students to search for information, create multimedia presentations, execute project work and
                        creatively present the content that they have gathered after comprehensive search from multiple
                        sources.<br><br>The IT teachers work hard with the students to sharpen their skills so that they
                        can compete with students from different parts of country.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">ROBOTICS LAB</h3>
                    <P>Integrating robotics into our curriculum fulfils the need of present-day learning environments
                        where our future leaders need to be technologically sound and can enhance their skills including
                        creativity, innovation, cooperation, team work and self confidence. Through hands-on learning
                        sessions, we aim at strengthening the bottom-line understanding of science, technology,
                        mathematics in a collaborative manner.<br><br>Robotics lab encourage question based approach of

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">OUTDOOR PLAY AREA</h3>
                    <P>We believe that play enhances every aspect of child’s development and learning. In fact, it is
                        child’s window to the external world and forms the foundation of social, intellectual, physical
                        and emotional skills that are requisite for success in school as well as life.
                        <br><br>The very idea of including play, in required ratio with the academics, fulfills the
                        prime objective of enriching students with creativity and thinking skills. To accomplish this,
                        we allow students to explore different environments by providing them playfields and facilities
                        for basketball, Cricket, Taekwondo, Swimming, etc. <br><br>Apart from giving students
                        opportunities, we foster their level of confidence with words of appreciation along with prizes
                        and awards at events organised in the school.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-1">SPORTS CENTRE</h3>
                    <P>Apart from a huge outdoor play area, we also have a Sports Centre that offers a range of indoor
                        games including table tennis, chess, and pool to students. The objective is to include every
                        game that can enhance their ability to not only focus on the goal, but also to help them create
                        their very own innovative approach to success. Simply put, our sports centre ignite the
                        potential of every student to follow their chosen path.</p>

                        student, to give wings to their creativity and to enhance their learning skills. Activity rooms
                        play a big role in strengthening the roots of talent in every student.
